Here is an example of a research paper I wrote for my quantitative data analysis class.

Bearing relatively more semblance to the technical writing process from my other works, I had to research, dissect concepts, document research methodology and present findings in a succinct fashion.

Interestingly, research writing also demands of the author to detail the research process such that it can be replicated and easily peer reviewed.
