### What is Travez?
* Travez is an online chat application aimed at redefining the way we plan and discover travel by connecting travellers to local guides.
* Through chat, travellers are able to get trip recommendations, automatically consolidate their itinerary in one place and explore unique local experiences in one place.
* Local guides were given access to a backend recommendation engine and experience card creator to help with the trip recommendation process.

### What happened?
* After raising $30k, I designed and with the help of contract developers, the MVP for the product was built and at its peak, Travez supported more than 200 travelers.
* This process helped me to learn how to get your first 100 customers, design and implement your product rapidly to validate ideas and truly understand that product and traction needs to go in tandem.

### What’s the user challenge?
* The user experience of discovering and planning travel is highly disjointed and ineffective.
* On average, it involves more than 80 hours of research, booking and planning across up to 8 different platforms.
* All this research and planning is driven by the need to maximise the travel experience overseas.

One way to look at the challenge is to see travellers as their own designers of their travel experiences.
*How might we help optimize this design process for travelers?*

### How did we go about researching and designing the product?

*TLDR:
Applied a design process that adapted Human-Centered Design with Lean Methodology.
Created user personas, conducted lean experimentations, ran design sprint to determine MVP product features interacting more than 100 customers & stakeholders.
Focused on alleviating the “half cup empty” mindset of travel planners.*

Adapting HCD with the lean methodology, it not only helped to shorten design sprints but also guided a rapid UX research process. Rather than simply building user personas through data gathering, every opportunity to interface with users was also an opportunity for lean experimentation.

Major insights gathered through in-depth interviews were quickly weighed based on the lean framework of “Leap of Faith”. The aim is to define a problem hypothesis that no further experimentation that can be feasibly conducted and pushed us to take a leap of faith.

For example, one thing I learnt from the process of understanding the customers was that a traveler plans to derive a sense of assurance so that time will be well spent during the travel. However, planning did not guarantee a satisfactory travel experience. As I reviewed the many recounts, I observed in planners a half-cup empty mindset when they recollect about their trip. They focused a lot on what they couldn't complete on the trip and lamented about a sense of unfulfillment where they felt that they never fully explored the place. On the contrary, travelers who ‘went with the wind’ went away with a greater sense of fulfillment despite spontaneous travel decision and recommendations by locals.

Upon uncovering this insight, it was hard to organize for further interviews to map out planning models and behaviors. I was pressed for time as a solo founder and wearing multiple hats to keep the startup afloat. Adopting the lean model, I was able to transit from research to product features design quickly be running experiments. We let a set of test users choose between a planning tool versus a planning process with a guide using the tool and 85% of the users chose to speak with an individual to get insights on what to do on the trip.

To clarify, this decision was made in a span of 2 days and the idea was to validate and kill our best ideas as quickly as possible as part of the agile development model. Now, this process guided my decision to skip the process of building a better research tool to help plan trips but jump straight into connecting the travelers with local guides through a chat interface.

Throughout the research process, more than 100 stakeholders and customers were interviewed and dozens of lean experimentation were conducted to validate the customer and problem hypothesis to form our solution and MVP design.

### What’s our solution:

The product tapped on three main product goals based on the initial research:
 1. Travelers almost always act on recommendations that they receive from their friends, family or locals.
 2. Travelers enjoy the process of discovering their travel plans (autonomy) but hate the process of consolidating or optimizing their travel plans.
 3. If given a choice, they would like to have an authentic travel experience that they could attain social currency with. Something that is non-mainstream and uniquely local.

 Key product features for users:
 1. Connect travelers with local guides via chat.
 2. Automatically generate an itinerary by streamlining recommendations, booking and planning using the proprietary experience cards and itinerary system.
 3. Discover uniquely local experiences hosted by local guides.

Key product features for guides:
1. A recommendation engine powered by crowdsourced answers and machine learning
2. An itinerary creator engine using experience cards as building block
3. Internal points, badge and leaderboard system to encourage answering of questions
