## Pivot from marketplace to small business SaaS tools

As the host retention rate dipped, we discovered that if we are unable to sustain the number of experience providers on our marketplace, we will not be able to sustain the platform as a marketplace.

Like any marketplace, it is supply-driven as demand generation requires availability of experiences users can book.

Traditional business development was not able to help us retain hosts as they are faced with the problem of maintaining too many marketplace platforms.

To differentiate ourselves, we had to deepen our host engagement. I led UX research with our host and helped to determine the key product features that our host needed. From the multiple interviews and studying the product usage data, I realized that our hosts were in need of a more fully-fledged booking and CRM system.

This led to Verlocal PRO and the most major pivot since the company's inception. Verlocal PRO differentiates itself from other booking tools by providing a fuss-free installation process and intuitive yet easy-to-use UI for online booking management. It steers clear from the bloated feature sets found in most online booking tools. With its affordable cost and one-day deployment promise, most small business owners or solo entrepreneurs have little to no qualms to consider other booking tools with this one-stop solution.

Verlocal PRO was also made universally embeddable in whatever website builder or website of the host. This additional functionality helped us to persuade hosts to move off of other booking tools as they can now manage their bookings seamlessly across their own website, Facebook page and on our marketplace.

Once our hosts integrate their business processes into our booking system, their availability and listings will continue to be served into our marketplace and help us to prevent droppage in availability.

I led the product design, co-owned the product roadmap with the CEO and determined the go-to-market and pricing strategy to help us achieve our first 100 small business users. As a result, our revenue increased by 50% in the three months since the launch of Verlocal PRO.

I also worked on redefining our host identity from passion enthusiasts to serious solo entrepreneurs. This created more resonance with our host community as they were indeed solo or small businesses who were offering workshosp and classes based on their skills and passions. This led to a rebranding of our host-facing website and marketing collaterals.
