I had the privilege of writing across a vast range of experiences and settings.

In the process, I found that writing is just one part of the equation. Rather, I also found myself needing to:
* Conduct interview and gather data from subject matter expert
* Research domain knowledge and find ways to explain expert knowledge to non-technical audiences
* Create a process to organize knowledge and documentation to make it easier to access
* Explore documentation tools to improve the process of collaborative writing
* Draft and edit multiple times so that the content is clear and concise
* Represent concepts and processes with visual diagrams

Documentation Tools that I have experience with:
* Jekyll + Github (XML)
* Gitbook (XML)
* Quip
* Google Suite
* Microsoft OneNote, Word
* Intercom for Customer Knowledge Base
* Adobe Creative Cloud & Sketch
* Lucidcharts, Xmind

For your reference, I would like to point you to these writing samples that required relatively similar aptitudes and disciplines to technical writing:
* [Curriculum Design](/curriculum) to provide training frameworks and instructions for trainers
* [Press Release](/pr) to communicate key messages
* [Research Paper](/research) to present research findings and methodology
* [Position Paper](/position) where you have to pull together resources in a short amount of time and communicate your stance to audiences who have no domain expertise
* [Landing Page Copywriting](https://www.verlocal.com/business) to highlight key value proposition of your product to grab attention and be attentive to styling for maximum visual persuasion
* [Step-by-step Instruction](http://stories.verlocal.com/2017/01/23/adding-verlocal-calendar-facebook-business-page/) to guide users through a series of tasks to deploy a product feature

**Verlocal PRO**

Verlocal PRO differentiates itself from other booking tools by providing a fuss-free installation process and intuitive yet easy-to-use UI for online booking management. It steers clear from the bloated feature sets found in most online booking tools. With its affordable cost and one-day deployment promise, most small business owners or solo entrepreneurs have little to no qualms to consider other booking tools with this one-stop solution.

Most of my technical writing was also for internal training technical documentation. I am unable to share exact examples due to sensitive nature of the information. Examples include teaching non-technical team members how to operate command terminal, accessing our internal SQL database, running Javascript to send email campaigns and editing HTML and CSS for our emailers.
