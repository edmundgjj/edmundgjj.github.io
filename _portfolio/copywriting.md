# Introduction

I benefit from a wide range of professional writing experiences - from writing academic papers, curriculum design and framework documentation, developing capacity building training toolkits, writing business plans to copywriting for product and content marketing.

A lot of these writing experiences involves a process more than simply writing. Rather, I have to:
* Conduct interview and gather data from subject matter expert
* Research domain knowledge and 'demystify' expert knowledge
* Drafting and editing so that content is user-friendly
* Representing concepts and processes with visual diagrams
* Adopt a minimalistic and simple writing style to make content easily
