intro:
  - title: "I love to solve problems across design, business and engineering."
  - excerpt: "With an academic background as a sociology researcher, I have an innate curiosity for human behavioural design and interactions. <br><br> After years of intensive learning by practice and working in three start-ups, I have self-taught myself design skills and front-end development. From UX research, user flow mapping, wireframing and product design, I am all-round designer.<br><br>
  Product design intrigues me as it allows me to tap into a multi-faceted problem solving mindset and work with different teammates from various background.
  I'm excited to explore any new product design opportunities."
